# maze_solver

## Project Overview

### Objectives:
A Completed C program to clearly show the step by step output of the Algorithm traversing and backtracking across the Maze.

### flow of the project:

### What did I learn :
I learnt how recursion and backtracking can be used implement various functions useful in automation in day to day life.
I also learnt different types of algorithm which can be used in  different scenarios and got to implement some of them.
I made a live apllication in command line so learnt a lot from the experience and also got to know how we can use these algorithms in real life scenarios for example a robot cleaner or a robot in a department store etc.
